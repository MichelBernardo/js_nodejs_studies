/*
1. Create variables that store the value of the balance, deposit, and withdrawal of a bank account,
then perform addition and subtraction operations between them using a variable called operation,
considering the function of each variable created. Display the final results in the console.*/



/*
2. Create a numeric variable with a value. Use a ternary operator to check whether this value is even or odd.
Display the result in the console.*/



/*
3. Consider a situation where you are checking if a user is logged in and has admin permission to access a specific feature.
Use boolean variables to simulate these conditions and use the AND operator to verify if both are true.
*/



/*
4. Declare two boolean variables and use the OR operator to check if at least one of them is true.
Display the result in the console.

/*
5. Imagine a system that determines whether a user is old enough to buy a ticket for a show.
Declare two variables that determine the minimum age required and the user’s age,
and use conditional structures (if, else) to determine if the user can make the purchase.
