1. VARIABLES ===========================================================

Declare three different variables (one for each type: string, number, and boolean) and assign values to them.
Then, display the type of each variable in the console.

Create two variables, one containing your first name and another containing your last name.
Then, combine them into a third variable using the + operator and into a fourth variable using template strings.
Finally, print the results in the console.

Declare two variables, one containing a number and the other a string.
Then, combine them into a third variable using template strings to form a sentence and display the result in the console.

Create a variable initialized with a value of any type, then reassign a new value to that variable.
Print both values in the console after assigning them.

Declare a variable using var outside a code block (for example, if) and another inside that block.
Try accessing those variables inside and outside the block using console.log and analyze the results.
Repeat the same process using let and compare with the previous results.

Declare a boolean variable that indicates whether it's raining and use it in a conditional structure (if) to display a message 
saying whether you need to take an umbrella or not, depending on the value of the variable.

2. DATA TYPES ===========================================================

Create a variable containing a sentence. Then, display in the console the length of the sentence and the same sentence in uppercase letters.

Declare two variables, one initialized with null and another with no assignment (resulting in undefined). Display the values in the console.

Create 3 variables of different types, use template strings to combine the different data types (number, string, boolean) into a 
single string, and display the result in the console.

Create a numeric variable and a string. Convert the numeric variable to a string and the string to a number. Display the resulting data 
types in the console.

Create a variable with a string and use string manipulation methods such as toUpperCase, toLowerCase, slice, or others to modify the
original string. Display the final results in the console.

3. OPERATORS ===========================================================

Create variables that store the value of the balance, deposit, and withdrawal of a bank account,
then perform addition and subtraction operations between them using a variable called operation,
considering the function of each variable created. Display the final results in the console.

Create a numeric variable with a value. Use a ternary operator to check whether this value is even or odd.
Display the result in the console.

Consider a situation where you are checking if a user is logged in and has admin permission to access a specific feature.
Use boolean variables to simulate these conditions and use the AND operator to verify if both are true.

Declare two boolean variables and use the OR operator to check if at least one of them is true. Display the result in the console.

Imagine a system that determines whether a user is old enough to buy a ticket for a show. Declare two variables that determine
the minimum age required and the user’s age, and use conditional structures (if, else) to determine if the user can make the purchase.

4. FUNCTIONS ===========================================================

Create a function that receives a person's name as an argument and returns a personalized greeting.
Then, call the function and display the greeting in the console.

Create a function that receives a person's age and returns whether they are an adult (age >= 18).
Print the result in the console.

Create a function that receives a string and checks whether it is a palindrome (a word that reads the same backward and forward)
using the string reverse() method. Return true if it is a palindrome and false otherwise.
Print the result in the console.

Create a function that receives three numbers as parameters and determines which one is the largest.
Use conditional structures (if, else) to compare the values and determine the largest.
Print the largest value in the console.

Create an arrow function called calculaPotencia that receives two parameters: the base and the exponent.
The function should calculate the base raised to the exponent and return the result.
